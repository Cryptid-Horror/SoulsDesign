A marking that has the "marking/base dependant" swatch as allowed is a marking that can be altered to be shades of the color modifier, if the color modifier is applied to the base coat. Otherwise, it is not allowed.
A huge example of the power behind a color modifier marking is in this kind of combination, however keep in mind we cannot detail every possible combination! This example uses citrine, but applies to all color modifiers. This examples is even for a Recessive gene!
citrine is applied to the base. Smoke is base dependant and is now shades of citrine. Stained is layered above smoke and is now also shades of citrine overtop of smoke. Duotone is applied to stained, and now stained has two shades of citrine applies. Ontop of this, dusted is residing above all these markings, and is allowed to be shades of citrine as well.',
